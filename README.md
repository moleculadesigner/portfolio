# Me

I am Danila Iakovlev, a PhD fellow in Novosibirsk Institute of Chemical Biology
and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS. My fields of scientific interest are:
* Protein structures;
* Protein dynamics;
* Nature of biocatalysis;
* Visualization of biomolecules and, generally, scientific information representation
  and design.

Also I like making strange electronic music
([Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/moleculadesigner)), cooking and snowboarding.

## Main Work @ ICBFM

My postgraduate work is about conformational dymanics of DNA repair proteins.
I concider BER pathway participants, which repair U:G and T:G mismathces. Our team has
already described two of these enzymes: human MBD4 and SMUG1.

MBD4 is a critical player in DNA demethylation process, it removes
5-methyluracil derivatives in special CpG domains.
We investigated its non-stationary kinetics and
published results in [*Acta Naturae*](Articles/Acta-Naturae-MBD4.pdf).

SMUG1 is a bit simpler guy: it just removes uracil and 5-hydroxymethyluracil
from DNA. But there is still no crystal structure of human SMUG1. We made a model
structure of it and [studied its kinetics](Articles/MolBioSystems-SMUG1.pdf).
Results were also represented at FEBS Congress 2018 ([poster](Posters/FEBS-2018.pdf)).

## Pet projects

As a result of Lifecodeâ€“2017 hackathon we made a toy investigation
([slides](Talks/LifeCode-2017-hackathon.pdf), [poster](Posters/BGRS-SB-2018.pdf))
for amino acid distribution within a protein core and
possibility to spatially recognise domains.
Works not very well, but domains are usually detected.
